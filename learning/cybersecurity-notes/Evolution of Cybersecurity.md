## Key Concepts
- **Virus:** Malicious code to damage systems.
- **Worm:** Self-replicating malware.
- **Malware:** Any software designed to harm devices/networks.
- **Social engineering:** Exploiting human error to gain access.

## Early Cybersecurity Attacks
- **Brain Virus (1986)**
	- By "Alvi Borthers". They created the virus to stop people from pirating their medical software. Started from Pakistan.

- **Morris Worm (1988)**
	- By "Robert Tappan Morris" in 1988. the first Internet worm, was made to measure the size of the internet but it ended up spreading uncontrollably(reinstalled it self infinitely). It infected about 6000 computers and caused major slowdowns. Started from NYC, USA
	- This led to create CERTs (Computer Emergency Response Teams)
	
	

- **ILOVEYOU (Love Letter Worm) (2000)**
	- By "Onel de Guzman" in 2000. It spread by email with the subject "ILOVEYOU" and when opened, it copied itself to the all the people connected to the same network and deleted their files. The main goal of this worm was to steal Internet log in credentials. infected millions of computers and caused around $10 billion in damages. 
	  Started from Philippines.
	- It was the first example of Social engineering.

- **Equifax(2017)**
	 - The U.S. government charged four members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army [FBI's report on the Equifax breach](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/chinese-hackers-charged-in-equifax-breach-021020) 
	 - Hackers obtained names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, and in some cases, driver's license and credit card numbers.
## Security Domains (by CISSP)
* CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professionals) These domains show how a team of security can work together, so they organized these 8 security domains (no need to be an expert in all of these, but having a general knowledge is required) :
* 1- **Security and risk management**
	* Defining goals and objectives
	
* 2- **Asset security**
	* Taking care of physical and digital assets (Credit card, Personal Info etc.)
	
* 3- Security architecture and engineering
	* Optimizing data security using tools, systems etc (like firewall) .
	
* 4- Communication and network security
	* Securing physical networks and wireless communications. (like analyzing a user behavior or creating a network policy)
	
* 5- Identity and access management
	* Ensuring users follow policies to control, manage and keep the data and assets, secure.
	* You do this by validating user identities and documenting access roles.
	
* 6- Security assessment and testing
	* Conducting security tests, collecting and analyzing user data to find risks, threats and vulnerabilities. 
	
* 7- Security operations
	* Operations and Investigations against threats.

* 8- Software development security
	* Using secure coding practices to create safe software.
	* They may cooperate with software development team, to create safe software.
